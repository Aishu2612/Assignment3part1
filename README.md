# Assignment3part1
In this part we have downloaded the inheritance_lab pdf from the portal
Implemented a parent class HospitalEmployee as a java file in eclipse which contains two protected instance variables: String name and int number
Created the subclasses Nurse and Doctor where both of them has the inherited variables and additionally Doctor has a new instance variable for specialty whereas Nurse has a new variable numOfPatients here we also Implemented a constructor and override the toString method for these two classes.
Then I  created a Surgeon class with a new instance called variable operating which indicates whether  the surgeon is on operating or not and implemented a constructor and toString method for Surgeon class.
Then I executed the code by clicking on Run and Debug option which we can find on top left corner or by right clicking on the code window
Firstly, I executed the code without work function and debugged the code when I found few errors and after some modifications I executed the code successfully without any errors
Then I executed the code with work function and debugged the code when I found any errors just like before
Finally I got the expected output and uploaded the code to github by creating a public repository
